# Liquid Group Guides

Version: 0.3 (12/9/16)

A WordPress plugin that allows for the creation and posting of group guides to a WordPress site.

## Underlying Implementation

This plugin uses a custom post type (CPT), several taxonomies, and custom permalinks to store and display information relating to group guides.

## Recommended Plugin

We recommend using Just Tadlock's Members plugin to restrict users to utilizing only the guides section of the administration site.

## ToDo

* Shortcodes currently use wordpress install specific term ids, need to make generic.
* Flush permalinks during activation.
* Auto-create guide types during activation.

## Authors

This plugin is a project of Liquid Church developed by Dave Mackey (<a href="https://github.com/davidshq">davidshq</a>) and Rick Murtagh (<a href="https://github.com/rmurtagh">@rmurtagh</a>).
